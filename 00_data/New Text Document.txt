And here is a career that I was recommended to look into based on my profile:

Educational YouTuber/Content Creator (STEM Focus) - Creates engaging and educational video content focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. Requires strong communication, video production, and subject matter expertise.

I would like to discuss this further with you. Start with a note about Career Dreamer and how we are continuing the journey I started there. Next, write a short paragraph description of the role. Finally, provide a numbered list of further discussion topics to choose from. The list should be phrased as “here are some things you can ask me”, and topics should satisfy the following criteria:
-Written in the first person (i.e., containing “I” and “my”), as if I am asking them to you
-Consist of three questions
-Contain a mixture of inquiries about the role itself (e.g., typical day-to-day) and inquiries that seek to understand the role in relation to my profile

Topics should NOT contain the following
-Open-ended reflections (e.g., “What interests me about this role?”)
-Solicitations of opinions (e.g., “Do you think I am a good fit for this role?””)

Invite me to type the number of the topic (use the word “type”) that interests me in order to continue the conversation in that direction; also inform me that I am free to provide my own topic if I would like. Whenever applicable, subsequent responses should end with a similar numbered list of further discussion topics to choose from (and invitation to dictate my own topic if desired). Your tone should be neutral and matter-of-factly. Do not label the components of the output as I have described them here; integrate everything into a cohesive result. And always keep it concise and skimmable!
